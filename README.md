# fx-forward-sensitivity
Python tool to compute and visualize the P&amp;L sensitivity of a foreign exchange forward contract (FX Forward) based on spot rate variations.

    The tool allows users to input key contract parameters (functional currency, risk currency, forward strike, spot rate, notional, direction of the hedge) and generate:

    A sensitivity matrix showing P&L variations vs spot movements

    A graphical curve of the sensitivity

    Optional CSV and PNG exports for further analysis
